<title>Role based access control (RBAC)</title>
<para>Role Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts access to the
        capabilities of Rackspace Cloud services, including the Cloud
        &PRODNAME; API, to authorized users only. RBAC enables
        Rackspace Cloud customers to specify which account users of
        their Cloud account have access to which &PRODNAME; API
        service capabilities, based on roles defined by Rackspace (see
            <xref linkend="RBAC_product_roles_table"/>). The
        permissions to perform certain operations in the &PRODNAME;
        API – create, read, update, delete – are assigned to specific
        roles. The account owner assigns these roles, either
        multiproduct (global) or product-specific (for example, &PROD; only) 
        to account users. </para>
<section xml:id="assigningRoles">
<title>Assigning roles to account users</title>
<para>The account owner (<code>identity:user-admin</code>) can
            create account users on the account and then assign roles
            to those users. The roles grant the account users
            specific permissions for accessing the capabilities of the
            &PROD; service. Each account has only one account owner, 
            and that role is assigned by default to any
            Rackspace Cloud account when the account is created. </para>

    <para> Two roles (observer and admin) can be used to access the

<para> Additionally, two multiproduct roles apply to all products.

            products when those products become RBAC-enabled. The

        <title>Resolving conflicts between RBAC multiproduct vs.
            custom (product-specific) roles</title>
        <para>
            The account owner can set roles for both multiproduct and &PROD; scope, and it is
            important to understand how any potential conflicts among these roles are resolved. When
            two roles appear to conflict, the role that provides the more extensive permissions takes
            precedence. Therefore, admin roles take precedence over observer roles, because admin
            roles provide more permissions.
