<title>Role Based Access Control (RBAC)</title>
<para>Role Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts access to the
capabilities of Rackspace Cloud services, including the Cloud
&PRODNAME; API, to authorized users only. RBAC enables Rackspace
Cloud customers to specify which account users of their Cloud
account have access to which &PRODNAME; API service
capabilities, based on roles defined by Rackspace (see <xref
linkend="RBAC_product_roles_table"/>). The permissions to
perform certain operations in &PRODNAME; API – create, read,
update, delete – are assigned to specific roles, and these
roles can be assigned by the Cloud account admin user to
account users of the account. </para>
<section xml:id="assigningRoles">
<title>Assigning Roles to Account Users</title>
<para>The account admin user (<code>identity:user-admin</code>) can
            create account users on the account and then assign roles
            to the account users. The roles grant the account users
            specific permissions for accessing the capabilities of the
            &PROD; service. Only one Cloud account admin user is
            allowed per account, and it is assigned by default to any
            Rackspace Cloud account when the account is created. </para>

      Currently, three roles can be used to access the &PROD; API. These roles, admin, creator, and observer,
        apply to this specific product. The following table
        describes these roles and their permissions.

        <title>RBAC Global versus Product Roles</title>
        <!-- this section is new and maybe needs review by the editor -->
        <para>
            The API user may set global and product-specific roles that on the surface, 
            appear to conflict. 
            When this happens, the more permissive role wins. 
            For example, if a user has both global observer role and product-specific admin role, the product admin role overrides the global observer role for the specified product. 
            All other products stay observer-only. 
            The admin role is the more permissive one, 
            providing more authority, so it takes precedence.
        </para>

            The following table shows two examples of the resolution of apparently-conflicting user roles:
