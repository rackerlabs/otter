Rackspace pricing and terms of serviceÂ 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Auto Scale is free for Cloud Servers customers. Use it as much and as often as you need, 
through the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel or APIs. You only pay for the servers you spin up 
based on the `Rackspace Cloud pricing`_ schedule.

The service level agreement (SLA) for Rackspace Cloud Services is included in the `Rackspace Cloud SLA`_.

The terms of service are part of the `Rackspace Cloud Terms of Service`_. Periodically 
review these terms because they can be updated any time.
