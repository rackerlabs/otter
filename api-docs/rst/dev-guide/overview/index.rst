About the Autoscale API
-----------------------------

The Rackspace Auto Scale API enables developers to interact with the 
Rackspace Autoscale service through a simple Representational State 
Transfer (REST) web service interface. 

You use the Auto Scale service to automatically scale 
resources in response to an increase or decrease in overall workload
based on user-defined policies. You can set up a schedule for launching
Auto Scale or define an event that is triggered by Cloud Monitoring. You
can also specify a minimum and maximum number of cloud servers, the
amount of resources that you want to increase or decrease, and the
thresholds in Cloud Monitoring that trigger the scaling activities. 

To use Auto Scale through the API, you submit API requests to define a 
scaling group consisting of cloud servers and cloud load balancers or 
RackConnect v3. Then you define policies, either schedule-based or monitoring-based. For
monitoring-based policies, you define cloud monitoring alerts to watch
the group's activity, and you define scaling rules to change the scaling
group's configuration in response to alerts. For schedule-based
policies, you simply set a schedule. Because you can change a scaling
group's configuration in response to changing workloads, you can begin
with a minimal cloud configuration and grow only when the cost of that
growth is justified.
