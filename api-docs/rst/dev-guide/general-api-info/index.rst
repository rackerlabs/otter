General API information
-------------------------

Ideas explained here are relevant to all operations of the API. See the 
:ref:`API Reference <api-reference>` for details about specific operations.

The Auto Scale API is implemented using a RESTful web service interface.
Like other products in the Rackspace Cloud suite, Auto Scale shares a
common token-based authentication system that allows seamless access
between products and services.
