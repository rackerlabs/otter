Get your credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To communicate with Rackspace Cloud services by using the REST API, you need
your Rackspace Cloud account username, API key, and account number.

.. note::
     In the API documentation, the account number is referred to as
     your *tenant ID* or *tenant name*.

To get this information, log in to the
:mycloud:`Rackspace Cloud Control Panel<>`.

-  Your account username is the username that you use to log in.

-  To get your account number, click the **ACCOUNT** menu in the top
   navigation bar. The account number is shown at the top of the
   menu.

-  To get your API key, follow the instructions in
   :how-to:`View and reset your API key <view-and-reset-your-api-key>`.

.. important::
      Protect your API key. Do not expose the value in code samples, screen
      captures, or insecure client-server communications. Also, ensure that
      the value is not included in source code that is stored in public
      repositories.
