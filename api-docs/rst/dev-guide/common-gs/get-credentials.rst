`Log in to the Rackspace Cloud Control panel`_ to get your Rackspace Cloud account username,

     In the API service documentation, the account number is referred to as your tenant ID
     or tenant name.

After you log in, click your username on the upper-right side of the top navigation pane.
Then, select **Account Settings** to open the page.
