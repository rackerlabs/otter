API v1.1 release, December 08, 2015
-----------------------------------

What's new
~~~~~~~~~~
* Added a new **convergence** endpoint. You can submit a **POST** request to this endpoint to trigger convergence. Convergence implies that Autoscale tries to continuously converge to the desired state of the scaling group, instead of manipulating servers only once.
When this convergence process starts, it will continue until the desired number of servers are in **ACTIVE** state.

* Added the `status` attribute for group state. This attribute can be either "ACTIVE" or "ERROR". An "ACTIVE" status means that the group is converging
and everything is operating well. An "ERROR" status means that Autoscale has stopped converging due to an irrecoverable error that requires user attention.
If the `status` attribute is set to "ERROR", an additional `error` attribute is added that displays a list of errors that Autoscale has encountered.

* Added support for "pause". Pausing a scaling group cancels any executions on the group.
This includes policy executions via the API and triggering convergence. Any existing convergence that is running will be stopped. Group configuration changes are allowed during a paused state.
If a scaling group is paused, the group state will return `"paused": true`.

* Added support for "resume". Resuming a scaling group ends the "pause" state. When a scaling group is resumed, policy executions and convergence triggering resume. The group state returns ``"paused": false`.
