============
Git Workflow
============

New features, bugfixes, etc. should be worked on in separate branches.  Before they can be merged into
master, a pull request should be openned on the branch, and the code reviewed.  Only after the code
passes review should it be merged into master.

#. Pull requests should be the smallest change that makes sense.  If a feature/task/bugfix touches a
   lot of files,  possible it should be split up into multiple pull requests that are based upon each
   other.

#. Commit messages should be informative as to the changes being made. A message like "Added validation
   for the server build config to fix issue AUTO-XXXX" or "Changed timeout to prevent spammy logging
   observed in production" would be good, whereas a commit messages like "lint" or "error" would be
   vague and unspecific.

#. NEVER squash merges.  Always use the github merge button to merge a branch into master.

#. Address review comments in additional commits in the branch.  This makes it easier for the reviewer
   to see which comments have been addressed, and to look at changes since the last review.  This
   project currently has no restrictions on the number of commits that can be merged into master.

#. ``git push --force`` should be used carefully and probably sparingly (if a rebase must happen on a
   branch, for instance), and never to master. Merging from master is an acceptable alternative to
   rebasing.

#. If you are using a version of git >= 1.8, please use ``git config push.default current`` (or
   alternatively ``git config --global push.default current``), so that if a branch argument is left
   off of ``git push``, by default it pushes the current branch to the remote branch of the same name.

   Alternately, this function by Phil Kates/Jordan Evans helps to avoid accidentally pushing to
   master::

       function gpthis() {
          git_branch=$(git_current_branch)
          if [ $git_branch = 'master' ]
          then
              echo "\nWon't merge branch master."
              echo "If you really want to merge to master, please run:"
              echo "   git push origin master"
          else
              git push $1 origin HEAD:$git_branch
          fi
       }
