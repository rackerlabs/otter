Converger service

# # Note [Convergence cycles]
#
# A very abstract version of our convergence cycle:
# - CYCLE (every N seconds)
# - find all divergent flags for this node's groups
# - for each group (that's not in `currently_converging`)
#   - add to currently_converging
#   - run a single convergence iteration
#   - remove from currently_converging
# - IF group is fully converged, delete divergent flag
# - ELSE goto CYCLE
#
# Importantly for the cycle logic, divergent flags are not deleted when the
# group has not yet fully converged. This is the mechanism by which the
# "cycling" actually happens -- we repeatedly run a convergence iteration until
# we determine it's fully converged, and then we finally delete the flag. See
# [Divergent flags] for more details about the divergent flag.
#
# So: currently_converging lasts for a single *iteration*,
#     divergent flags last for a whole *cycle*.
#
# `currently_converging` is a set of group IDs that are being converged *within
# a node*. We keep track of this since we receive notifications that groups are
# divergent asynchronously with the actual convergence process. If a group is
# in that set when we notice a divergent flag, we ignore it, *without* deleting
# the divergent flag, so we will still check that group on the next cycle.


# # Note [Divergent flags]
#
# We run the convergence service on multiple servers. We want to divvy up this
# work stably between the different nodes such that a group is always converged
# by the same node -- this is to avoid accidentally running convergence
# iterations concurrently for the same group, which could lead to unnecessary
# creation/deletion of resources as the concurrent processes race against each
# other. In order to do this, we use a ZooKeeper set partitioner (see
# otter.util.zkpartitioner). All groups are stably mapped to a partitioned
# "bucket" via a simple hash/mod algorithm.
#
# In order to actually register that a group needs convergence, we create a
# ZooKeeper node with the name of the tenant and group, and convergence nodes
# watch the ZK directory and filter for groups that map to their allocated
# buckets.
#
# Marking a group divergent (or "dirty") is tricky enough that just using a
# boolean flag for "is group dirty or not" won't work, because that will allow
# a race condition that can lead to stalled convergence. Here's the scenario,
# with Otter nodes 'A' and 'B', assuming only a boolean `dirty` flag:
#
# - A: policy executed: groupN.dirty = True
# - B: converge group N (repeat until done)
# - A: policy executed: groupN.dirty = True
# - B: groupN.dirty = False
#
# Here, a policy was executed on group N twice, and A tried to mark it dirty
# twice. The problem is that when the converger node finished converging, it
# then marked it clean *after* node A tried to mark it dirty a second time.
# It's a small window of time, but if it happens at just the right moment,
# after the final iteration of convergence and before the group is marked
# clean, then the changes desired by the second policy execution will not
# happen.
#
# So instead of just a boolean flag, we'll take advantage of ZK node
# versioning. When we mark a group as dirty, we'll create a node for it if it
# doesn't exist, and if it does exist, we'll write to it with `set`. The
# content doesn't matter - the only thing that does matter is the version,
# which will be incremented on every `set` operation. On the converger side,
# when it searches for dirty groups to converge, it will remember the version
# of the node. When convergence completes, it will delete the node ONLY if the
# version hasn't changed, with a `delete(path, version)` call.
#
# The effect of this is that if any process updates the dirty flag after it's
# already been created, the node won't be deleted, so convergence will pick up
# that group again. We don't need to keep track of exactly how many times a
# group has been marked dirty (i.e. how many times a policy has been executed
# or config has changed), only if there are _any_ outstanding requests for
# convergence, since convergence always uses the most recent data.
