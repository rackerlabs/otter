# It is possible to create an invalid launch config (one that fails to create
# a server) - (1) we don't validate against nova yet, (2) even if it validates
# against nova at creation time, they may delete an image or network, and (3)
# it is possible for the user to create a server that is not connected to
# either the public net or the ServiceNet.

# TODO: we need some strategy for perhaps warning the user that their launch
# config has problems.  Perhaps a no-op validation endpoint that lists all the
# problems with their launch configuration, or perhaps accept the launch
# configuration and return a warning list of all possible problems.
